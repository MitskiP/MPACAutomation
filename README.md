# MPACAutomation

Android app to control my Air Conditioner with my phone through Infra Red.

## Requirements

- A phone or tablet with a bluetooth blaster staying at home. This one acts as the server and listens for changes in Firebase.
- Another Android device of your choice, probably your main phone.
- IR code to send to your AC (I am using a daikin model)
- Firebase account ready to use. Create the missing file ```app/google-services.json```
